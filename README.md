•	Our dataset has 9 attributes and approx. 1 lakh rows.
•	Our dataset has no outliers and missing data as shown in the screen shots of our EDA above.
•	We don’t have any incomplete or inconsistent or duplicate data in our dataset, it’s a clean dataset that we have found.
•	When we checked for the correlation between the attributes of the dataset, it was found that the attributes are highly correlated with each other, and with my assumptions I can claim that those correlation numbers are spurious.
•	In our dataset, no PCA (dimensionality reduction) was required for it to be processed easily.
•	From our graph we can easily draw conclusions about the data present that the price of stocks, may go down or up over a course of a month, but there is a definite annual increase in the price of the stock, which is clear from the candlestick graph that’s been plotted above.
